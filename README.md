# 🧪 rags-lab
> ##### A centralized repo for everything related to RAGs. Resources, Research, Notes, The Future, & more.

## 🧠 What is rags-lab?

**rags-lab** is a structured repository where researchers, developers, and builders can,
- 📚 Collect and share RAG-related resources (papers, frameworks, tools)
- 💡 Propose and discuss new RAG ideas or architectures
- 🧩 **Document:** Experiment, iterate, and refine concepts through open collaboration
- 🚀 Commit to building implementations once an idea matures

The goal is simple... create a **living workspace** that bridges **research discussions** & **real implementations**.

## 🧩 Repository Structure
```bash
rags-lab/
├── 📄 papers/ # Research papers, surveys, and academic references
├── 🧰 frameworks/ # Open-source libraries, APIs, and base architectures
├── 🧠 tutorials/ # Hands-on guides and experiment notebooks
├── 🧩 discussions/ # PR-based brainstorming threads & proposals
├── 💡 ideas/ # Accepted concepts and design summaries
├── 📊 benchmarks/ # Evaluation datasets, metrics, and test results
└── 🧪 implementations/ # Finalized and in-progress project builds
└── resources.md
└── ...
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

The collaboration model for **rags-lab** is intentionally simple and discussion-driven:

1. **Propose an Idea**
   - Create a new branch or open a **Pull Request**  
   - Add your proposal under `/discussions` or `/ideas`  
   - Describe the idea clearly: What problem it solves, Why it matters, & How it might work  

2. **Discuss**
   - Community members join the PR thread
   - Exchange feedback, iterate, and refine the approach

3. **Decide**
   - Once there’s consensus, the PR can be merged (accepted) or closed (archived)  
   - Accepted ideas move to `/ideas` or `/implementations` depending on maturity  

4. **Build**
   - Contributors can volunteer to prototype or implement the accepted idea  
   - Implementations live under `/implementations` with proper documentation  

## 🔍 Ideal Contributions

- 📖 Interesting RAG papers, survey summaries, or key insights  
- 🧩 New framework architectures or evaluation methods  
- 💡 Novel RAG mechanisms (graph retrieval, memory loops, multi-agent RAGs, etc.)  
- 🧠 Experimental concepts or design proposals  
- 🧰 Benchmarks, tools, and reproducibility efforts  

## 💬 Discussions via Pull Requests

All discussions in **rags-lab** happen through **Pull Requests**, not issues. Think of each PR as a focused conversation... a space to brainstorm and debate ideas **before** committing anything to main.

**Example workflow**
```bash
# Fork the repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/rags-lab.git
cd rags-lab

# Create a branch for your idea
git checkout -b feature/graph-rag

# Add your idea under /discussions/
git add discussions/graph-rag.md
git commit -m "Proposal: Graph-based RAG architecture"
git push origin feature/graph-rag

# Open a Pull Request and start the discussion
```

## 👥 Contribution Guidelines
- Use clear proposal titles for PRs (e.g., Proposal: Context-Optimized RAG)
- Keep discussions focused on technical exploration and feasibility
- Once an idea is accepted, link related papers, frameworks, and code snippets
- Be respectful, concise, and data-driven in feedback

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the full process.
